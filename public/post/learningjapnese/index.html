<p>If there was a secret recipe to learning a language and it basically guarenteed that you would be fluent in the language sometime in the future, would you take it? Probably, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be easy to keep up with it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait what do you mean Mr. Writer, of course if something like that existed then I would definetly take it and become fluent in the language that I love&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Well, I hope that you love that language well enough because such a method does exist, and it&rsquo;s called Immersion.</p>
<p>This technique is pretty straightforward because you commit to what the name tells you to do which is immersing in the language you&rsquo;re trying to learn (or Japanese in this blog&rsquo;s case from this point on). However, in order to accomplish full immersion a person will need a lot of free time in their hands, so just ten minutes a day immersing in Japanese is not going to cut it (unless you&rsquo;re planning on spending at least 20 years in studying the language).</p>

<p>I woke up one and told myself that one day I will learn Japanese. And everything after that is to be continued.</p>
