# Intro

If there was a secret recipe to learning a language and it basically guarenteed that you would be fluent in the language sometime in the future, would you take it? Probably, but it wouldn't be easy to keep up with it.

"Wait what do you mean Mr. Writer, of course if something like that existed then I would definetly take it and become fluent in the language that I love".

Well, I hope that you love that language well enough because such a method does exist, and it's called Immersion.

This technique is pretty straightforward because you commit to what the name tells you to do which is immersing in the language you're trying to learn (or Japanese in this blog's case from this point on). However, in order to accomplish full immersion a person will need a lot of free time in their hands, so just ten minutes a day immersing in Japanese is not going to cut it (unless you're planning on spending at least 20 years in studying the language).


# A High School Pipe Dream

I woke up one and told myself that one day I will learn Japanese. And everything after that is to be continued.
