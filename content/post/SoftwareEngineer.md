# The Confusion Before The Experience
Some of the material studied to earn a computer science degree focuses on [theoretical fundamentals and computational algorithms](https://www.topuniversities.com/courses/computer-science-information-systems/guide) which a person with the degree could use to make further advances within the field (though they might need to pursue further mastery over the subject such as earning a masters or Phd [before pursuring research oppurtunities](https://web.cs.dartmouth.edu/undergraduate/graduate-school-advice)), but some gradutes might instead look to immediately jump start their careers within software engineering so their job search starts right after graduation. However even with proper schooling, an individual might still be confused as to what a software engineer actually needs to do on the job, especially if they never had any work experience prior to graduation. I think that to fully understand just a bit of the field of Software Engineering, I think that a person should gain experience in some of its branches which gives them a decent fundamental understanding of the general idea that covers almost any career in software engineering.

# The Software Developer
This person would work on the main portion of a software application. Also, it's a plus if whatever they develop can be run on any platform or be easily integrated into a web application (but that may be asking a bit too much during the first versions of the application). Although software development is a muscle that can be strenghtend through experience, just like any other engineer who deals with developing the architecture of a structure, [software developers require the proper schooling](https://blog.devmountain.com/web-development-vs-software-development-which-is-the-better-career-choice/) to instill the right theories and methodologies needed to contrust effiecient and reliable software applications.

# The Web Developer 
Another branch that stems from software engineering is web development. We can go even further by seperating them into back-end or front-end developers (although full-stack developers exist [but might be a bit more rare](https://www.themartec.com/insidelook/full-stack-developer-myth)).

Litterally just programming? To be continued
