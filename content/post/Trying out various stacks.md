So, having a bunch of different tools under our belt couldn't hurt a bit, in fact it may help overcome a lot of bottleneck issues that come up in the middle of developing a software application. 

# MERN (MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js)
A full-stack architecture I used for my first web application which was a bug tracker application I built based off of this youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC483DTjRXU&t=860s&ab_channel=CoderFoundry

Using a MongoDb cluster with the Node.js was easy because a JS package already existed called mongoose, and allowed the user to easily connect to their instance of MongoDB and call functions that interact with it, such as sending data to the cluster, fetching data from it, or creating a new model.

# Mern to come :)
